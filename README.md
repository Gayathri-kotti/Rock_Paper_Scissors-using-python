Rock,Paper and Scissors Game
Develop a Python console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game where players can
compete against the computer. Each player selects their choice (rock, paper, or
scissors), and the program determines the winner based on the classic game
rules. Display the result of each round, keep track of the score, and allow
players to play multiple rounds. Ensure the game handles invalid inputs and
provides a user-friendly experience.
